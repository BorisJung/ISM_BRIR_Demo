### Image Source Model Binaural Room Impulse Response Script

This script was developed as part of a portfolio exam during my master's studies at TU Berlin. It needs the [Auditory Modeling Toolbox](http://amtoolbox.sourceforge.net/), the [Large Time-Frequency Analysis Toolbox](https://ltfat.github.io/) as well as the [SOFA MatLab API](https://www.sofaconventions.org/mediawiki/index.php/SOFA_(Spatially_Oriented_Format_for_Acoustics)) included in the corresponding subfolder.

Once all set up, it calculates the binaural room impulse response of a rectangular room with parameters given by input variables. See pictures subfolder or ***01_project_paper.pdf*** for an overview of the functionality.
